# SmileUP App

Welcome to the SmileUP Donation App! Our app makes it easier and more engaging to donate to various causes. Users can scroll through donation opportunities, like the ones they care about, and immediately donate using tokens called Smiles. Users can earn Smiles by participating in community services or other tasks.
